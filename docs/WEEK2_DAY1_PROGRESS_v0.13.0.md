# Week 2 Day 1 Progress - v0.13.0 Proactive Intelligence

**Date**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
**Time Spent**: ~3 hours

---

## üìã Summary

Completed Day 1 of Week 2 implementation: **Suggestion Engine Foundation**. Successfully created a robust suggestion engine that analyzes file change patterns and generates intelligent recommendations for KB entries, tasks, refactoring, and anomaly detection.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Week 2 Implementation Plan (30 minutes)
- Created comprehensive 7-day plan: `docs/WEEK2_PLAN_v0.13.0.md`
- Defined 4 core features:
  - Proactive Suggestion Engine
  - 4 new MCP tools
  - User Behavior Tracking
  - Enhanced Context Awareness
- Detailed daily schedule with deliverables
- Success metrics and testing strategy

### 2. Priority Enum Added to Core Models (10 minutes)
- **File**: `clauxton/core/models.py`
- Added `Priority` enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- Added `TaskStatus` enum: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, BLOCKED
- Ensures type safety across the project

### 3. Suggestion Engine Implementation (1.5 hours)
- **File**: `clauxton/proactive/suggestion_engine.py` (141 statements)
- **Coverage**: 96% (only 6 statements missed)

**Key Classes**:
```python
class SuggestionType(Enum):
    KB_ENTRY = "kb_entry"
    TASK = "task"
    REFACTOR = "refactor"
    DOCUMENTATION = "documentation"
    CONFLICT = "conflict"
    ANOMALY = "anomaly"

class Suggestion(BaseModel):
    type: SuggestionType
    title: str
    description: str
    confidence: float  # 0.0-1.0
    reasoning: str
    affected_files: List[str]
    priority: Priority
    created_at: datetime
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    suggestion_id: Optional[str]

class SuggestionEngine:
    def analyze_pattern(pattern: DetectedPattern) -> List[Suggestion]
    def analyze_changes(changes: List[FileChange]) -> List[Suggestion]
    def calculate_confidence(evidence: Dict) -> float
    def rank_suggestions(suggestions: List[Suggestion]) -> List[Suggestion]
```

**Suggestion Strategies**:

1. **KB Entry Suggestions**:
   - Trigger: 3+ files in same module modified
   - Confidence: Base 0.6 + file count bonus
   - Example: "Document changes in src/auth"

2. **Task Suggestions**:
   - Trigger: Code files modified without tests
   - Confidence: 0.75
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Example: "Add tests for recent changes"

3. **Refactor Suggestions**:
   - Trigger: Large files detected
   - Confidence: 0.70
   - Priority: LOW
   - Example: "Consider splitting large files"

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Trigger: >10 changes in 10 minutes
   - Confidence: 0.7 + change count / 50
   - Priority: MEDIUM/HIGH
   - Example: "Rapid changes: 15 changes in 10 minutes"

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
def calculate_confidence(evidence):
    score = (
        evidence["pattern_frequency"] * 0.3 +    # 30%
        evidence["file_relevance"] * 0.25 +      # 25%
        evidence["historical_accuracy"] * 0.25 + # 25%
        evidence["user_context"] * 0.2           # 20%
    )
    return clip(score, 0.0, 1.0)
```

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (1 hour)
- **File**: `tests/proactive/test_suggestion_engine.py` (400 lines, 22 tests)
- **Result**: ‚úÖ 22/22 passing (100%)

**Test Coverage**:

- File change analysis (3 tests)
- Confidence scoring (2 tests)
- Suggestion ranking and deduplication (2 tests)

test_analyze_pattern_refactor()
test_analyze_changes_rapid_changes()
test_confidence_scoring()

## üîç Code Examples

### Example Usage:

```python
from clauxton.proactive.suggestion_engine import SuggestionEngine
from clauxton.proactive.models import DetectedPattern, PatternType, FileChange

# Initialize engine
engine = SuggestionEngine(project_root, min_confidence=0.7)

# Analyze pattern
pattern = DetectedPattern(
    pattern_type=PatternType.BULK_EDIT,
    files=[Path("src/auth.py"), Path("src/api.py"), Path("src/models.py")],
    confidence=0.85,
    description="Multiple files edited quickly"
)

suggestions = engine.analyze_pattern(pattern)

for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"{suggestion.type.value}: {suggestion.title}")
    print(f"Confidence: {suggestion.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Reasoning: {suggestion.reasoning}")
    print(f"Priority: {suggestion.priority.value}")
    print()

# Output:
# kb_entry: Document changes in src
# Confidence: 0.90
# Reasoning: Pattern 'bulk_edit' detected with 3 files
# Priority: medium
#
# task: Add tests for recent changes
# Confidence: 0.75
# Reasoning: Code changes without test coverage detected
# Priority: high
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Day 2)

### Tomorrow's Tasks (Oct 27):
1. **Advanced Suggestion Logic** (6-8 hours)
   - Implement documentation gap detection
   - Add code smell detection
   - Enhance refactoring suggestions
   - Improve anomaly detection algorithms
   - Target: 12+ new tests

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle empty patterns
   - Handle single-file changes
   - Handle rapid same-file edits
   - Handle cross-module changes

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache suggestion computations
   - Batch suggestion generation
   - Optimize path prefix calculation

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Went Well:
1. **Clean Architecture**: Using existing DetectedPattern/FileChange models worked perfectly
2. **Test-Driven**: Writing tests alongside code caught issues early
3. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models caught validation errors automatically
4. **Coverage**: 96% coverage from Day 1 gives confidence

### Challenges:
1. **Model Alignment**: Had to align with existing proactive models (DetectedPattern vs EventPattern)
2. **Test Conversion**: Automated conversion of test file broke syntax, needed manual rewrite
3. **Pydantic ValidationError**: Tests expected ValueError, got ValidationError instead

### Improvements for Next Time:
1. Check existing models before creating new ones
2. Avoid automated regex replacements for complex code changes
3. Test with actual Pydantic validation error types
