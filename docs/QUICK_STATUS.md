## ✅ What's Done (Session 9)

### Session 9 Goals vs Reality

**EXPECTED** (from plan):
- Write 100+ tests for "zero-coverage" modules
- 6-8 hours of work

**REALITY**:
- All modules already had 80%+ coverage! ✅
- 1 hour to verify and document
- Previous sessions did excellent work

### Verified Coverage (All ✅)
- operation_history.py: **81%** (24 tests)
- task_validator.py: **100%** (32 tests)
- logger.py: **97%** (25 tests)
- confirmation_manager.py: **96%** (15 tests)
- task_manager.py: **90%** (53 tests)

---

## 📋 What's Next (Session 10)

### Real Gaps Identified (After Verification)

**Core Modules** (Actual status - mostly good!):
- conflict_detector.py: **96%** ✅ (was reported as 14%)
- knowledge_base.py: **72%** → 80%+ (needs work)
- search.py: **86%** ✅ (was reported as 19%)

**Integration Tests** (THE REAL GAP - Currently 0%!):
- CLI integration: 0 → 23-29 tests ⭐ PRIMARY FOCUS
- MCP server: 0 → 8-10 tests ⭐ PRIMARY FOCUS
- File system: 0 → 5-7 tests

**Utils** (Acceptable for now):
- yaml_utils.py: 56% (acceptable)
- backup_manager.py: 55% (acceptable)
- file_utils.py: 67% (acceptable)

**Estimated**: 38-53 tests (mostly integration), 4-6 hours

## 🚨 Important Clarification

### Why Session 9 Was Confusing

**The Problem**:
Session 8's analysis claimed these modules had **0% coverage**:
- operation_history.py
- task_validator.py
- logger.py
- confirmation_manager.py

**The Reality**:
Session 9 discovered they **all had 80%+ coverage**!

**What Happened**:
- Session 8's analysis was based on stale/partial test data
- Previous sessions (1-8) had already done excellent work
- Session 9 verified the actual (excellent) state

**Lesson**: Always verify before planning new work!

## 🎯 Session Summary

### Session 8 (2025-10-20) ✅
**Focus**: Enhanced validation, undo, security
**Output**: +95 tests, undo functionality, Bandit integration
**Impact**: Production-ready validation layer

### Session 9 (2025-10-21) ✅
**Focus**: Coverage verification (not creation!)
**Output**: Verified 80%+ coverage, comprehensive docs
**Impact**: Confirmed production readiness
**Duration**: 1 hour (not 6-8 hours)

### Session 10 (Planned) 📋
**Focus**: Integration testing (real gap is 0% integration tests!)
**Output**: 38-53 tests (mostly integration), knowledge_base.py 72%→80%+
**Impact**: Production confidence through E2E testing
**Estimated**: 4-6 hours
