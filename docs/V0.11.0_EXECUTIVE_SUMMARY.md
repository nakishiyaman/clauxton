|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Manual KB entry time | 5 min | 1 min | **80% faster** |
| Task creation time | 2 min | 30 sec | **75% faster** |
| Codebase queries | Manual | <500ms | **Automatic** |
| MCP tools | 17 | 22 | +5 tools |
| Test count | 767 | ~990 | +225 tests |

## ðŸš€ Two Major Features

### 1. Repository Map (Priority 1)
**Effort**: 30 hours | **Impact**: HIGH

**What it does**:
Automatically indexes your entire codebase, extracting files, functions, classes, and dependencies. Claude Code can instantly understand project structure without manual KB entries.

**Key capabilities**:
- Index 10,000+ files in <10 seconds
- Extract symbols (functions, classes) from Python, JS, TS
- Build dependency graph with cycle detection
- Semantic search over code and comments
- Auto-populate KB with detected patterns

**Inspired by**: Aider's repository map, Devin's codebase understanding

**MCP Tools** (5 new):
- `map_index()` - Index codebase
- `map_query()` - Search by natural language
- `map_get_file()` - Get file details
- `map_get_related()` - Find related files
- `map_analyze()` - Detect architecture patterns

---

### 2. Interactive Mode (Priority 2)
**Effort**: 20 hours | **Impact**: MEDIUM

**What it does**:
Conversational interface for creating tasks and KB entries. No YAML knowledge required - just chat with Clauxton.

**Key capabilities**:
- Wizard-style task creation with AI suggestions
- Natural language task import from text files
- KB entry templates (ADR, pattern, constraint)
- Intelligent defaults based on project context

**Example**:
```
$ clauxton task create --interactive

ðŸ¤– What needs to be done?
ðŸ‘¤ Add user authentication

ðŸ¤– Found related files: api/users.py, services/auth_service.py
   Edit these? [Y/n]

ðŸ¤– Priority? [critical/high/medium/low]
ðŸ‘¤ high

âœ… Task created: TASK-003 (Add user authentication)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Vision

### Current State (v0.10.1)
âœ… Robust context management
âœ… Bulk operations with safety features
âœ… Production-ready quality (767 tests, 91% coverage)

### Gap
- Claude Code still needs manual KB entries
- Developers must know YAML format
- No automatic codebase understanding

### Future State (v0.11.0)
ðŸŽ¯ **Zero-effort context** - Clauxton learns from code
ðŸŽ¯ **Conversational workflows** - No YAML required
ðŸŽ¯ **Intelligent assistance** - AI-powered recommendations

## ðŸ“… Timeline

```
Week 0 (Now):           Planning & community feedback
Weeks 1-2:              Repository Map implementation
Weeks 3-4:              Interactive Mode implementation
Week 5:                 Integration testing & documentation
Week 6:                 Release preparation
Target Release:         End of Q1 2026
```

**Key Milestones**:
- Week 2: Working repository map demo
- Week 4: Interactive mode demo
- Week 5: Beta release for testers
- Week 6: Public release on PyPI

## ðŸ’° Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Development Cost
- **Time**: 77 hours (~13 hours/week Ã— 6 weeks)
- **Risk**: Medium (new technology like tree-sitter)
- **Complexity**: High (symbol extraction, NLP parsing)

### Expected Benefits
- **80% time savings** on context management
- **Lower barrier to entry** (no YAML knowledge)
- **Better Claude Code integration** (automatic understanding)
- **Competitive advantage** (unique intelligence layer)

### ROI
**High** - Core differentiator for Clauxton, enables future features

---

## ðŸš§ Key Risks

### Risk 1: Performance (HIGH severity, MEDIUM probability)
**Issue**: Large codebases may be slow to index
**Mitigation**: Incremental indexing, caching, background processing

### Risk 2: Language Support (MEDIUM severity, HIGH probability)
**Issue**: Symbol extraction only works for limited languages
**Mitigation**: Start with Python, add JS/TS later, provide fallback

### Risk 3: Scope Creep (HIGH severity, HIGH probability)
**Issue**: Too many features, timeline slips
**Mitigation**: Strict prioritization, defer optional features to v0.12.0

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Must Have (Release Blockers)
- âœ… Repository map indexes Python codebases
- âœ… Interactive task creation works end-to-end
- âœ… 90% test coverage maintained
- âœ… Performance targets met (<10s indexing, <500ms search)
- âœ… 5 new MCP tools fully tested

### Nice to Have (Can defer)
- ðŸ”„ Multi-language symbol extraction (JS, Go, Rust)
- ðŸ”„ Advanced NLP task parsing
- ðŸ”„ Code quality insights
- ðŸ”„ Smart conflict prediction
