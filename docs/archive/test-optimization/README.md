## Key Achievements

### Performance Improvements
- **Execution Time**: 52 minutes → 1m46s (97% faster)
- **CI Runtime**: ~8 minutes for default tests
- **Performance Tests**: Separated to weekly schedule (19 tests, ~70 minutes)

### Coverage Improvements
- **Overall**: 81% → 85%
- **MCP CLI**: 15% → 94% (+79%)
- **Repository Map**: 69% → 94% (+25%)
- **Repository CLI**: 65% → 70% (+5%)

### Test Additions
- **Phase 2**: 17 CLI tests (status, overview, stats, focus, continue, quickstart)
- **Phase 3**: 33 CLI tests (15 MCP + 18 Repository)
- **Total New Tests**: 50

### Code Quality
- **Lint**: ✅ All checks passed (ruff)
- **Type Check**: ✅ Success (mypy strict mode)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% (1,367/1,367 tests)

## Technical Improvements

### Test Infrastructure
- Created `tests/cli/conftest.py` for shared fixtures
- Eliminated fixture code duplication
- Added pytest markers (`@pytest.mark.performance`)
- Configured default test exclusions in `pyproject.toml`

### CI/CD Enhancements
- Weekly performance test schedule (Sundays 02:00 UTC)
- Manual workflow trigger capability
- Separated fast feedback (default) vs comprehensive (weekly) testing

### Documentation Updates
- README.md testing section added
- Coverage badge updated
- CI/CD workflow explanation
- Test execution guide for developers

## Recommendations Implemented

1. ✅ Separate performance tests for fast feedback
2. ✅ Weekly automated performance testing
3. ✅ Manual CI trigger for on-demand performance tests
4. ✅ Comprehensive CLI test coverage
5. ✅ Shared fixture organization
6. ✅ Documentation updates
7. ✅ 85% coverage threshold (industry standard exceeded)

## Future Considerations

### Optional Improvements
- Reach 90% coverage by adding 30-40 tests to `cli/main.py` (currently 69%)
- Add scenario tests for multi-project management
- Add scenario tests for long-term data accumulation
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md for open-source development

### Monitoring
- Weekly performance test results review
- Coverage trend tracking
- Test execution time monitoring
