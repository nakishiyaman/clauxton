[![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-alpha-orange.svg)](https://github.com/nakishiyaman/clauxton)

> ⚠️ **Alpha Status**: Clauxton is currently in Phase 0 development. Core features are being implemented. Not yet ready for production use.

Clauxton is a Claude Code plugin that provides **persistent project context** to solve AI-assisted development pain points.

**Vision** (Roadmap):
1. ✅ **Session Context Loss** → Persistent Knowledge Base (Phase 0 - In Progress)
2. 🔄 **Manual Dependency Tracking** → Auto-inferred task dependencies (Phase 1 - Planned)
3. 🔄 **Post-hoc Conflict Detection** → Pre-merge conflict prediction (Phase 2 - Planned)

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

> **Note**: CLI installation only. Full Claude Code plugin integration coming in Phase 1.

```bash
# Install from source (PyPI release coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/nakishiyaman/clauxton.git
cd clauxton
pip install -e .

# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
clauxton init

# Add knowledge to your Knowledge Base
clauxton kb add

# Search your Knowledge Base
clauxton kb search "architecture"
```

---

## ✨ Features

### ✅ Phase 0: Foundation (In Progress)

#### Knowledge Base Management
- ✅ **Persistent Context**: Store architecture decisions, patterns, constraints, conventions
- ✅ **Category System**: Organize entries by type (architecture, constraint, decision, pattern, convention)
- ✅ **YAML Storage**: Human-readable, Git-friendly YAML format
- ✅ **Search**: Keyword, category, and tag-based search
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: Add, get, update, delete, list entries
- ✅ **Atomic Writes**: Safe file operations with automatic backups
- ✅ **Secure Permissions**: 700/600 permissions for privacy

### 🔄 Phase 1: Core Engine (Planned)

#### Task Management
- 🔄 **Auto Dependency Inference**: Infer dependencies from code edits
- 🔄 **DAG Validation**: Prevent circular dependencies
- 🔄 **Next Task Suggestions**: AI recommends what to work on next
- 🔄 **MCP Integration**: Knowledge Base & Task Management MCP servers

### 🔄 Phase 2: Conflict Prevention (Planned)

#### Pre-merge Conflict Detection
- 🔄 **File Overlap Detection**: Detect potential merge conflicts
- 🔄 **Risk Scoring**: Calculate conflict risk (0.0-1.0)
- 🔄 **Safe Execution Order**: Recommend optimal task order
- 🔄 **Drift Detection**: Detect scope expansion

## 📦 Installation

### Development Installation (Current)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nakishiyaman/clauxton.git
cd clauxton

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
clauxton --version
```

### PyPI Installation (Coming Soon)

```bash
pip install clauxton
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Current Commands (Phase 0)

```bash
# Initialize Clauxton in your project
clauxton init

# Add knowledge entry (interactive)
clauxton kb add

# Search Knowledge Base
clauxton kb search "architecture"
clauxton kb search "API" --category architecture

# List all entries
clauxton kb list
clauxton kb list --category decision

# Get entry by ID
clauxton kb get KB-20251019-001
```

### MCP Server (Phase 1 - Available Now!)

The Clauxton MCP Server provides Knowledge Base tools for Claude Code:

```json
// .claude-plugin/mcp-servers.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clauxton-kb": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "clauxton.mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
}
```

**Available Tools**:
- `kb_search(query, category?, limit?)` - Search Knowledge Base
- `kb_add(title, category, content, tags?)` - Add new entry
- `kb_list(category?)` - List all entries
- `kb_get(entry_id)` - Get entry by ID

See [MCP Server Guide](docs/mcp-server.md) for complete documentation.

### Coming in Phase 1

```bash
# Task Management tools (Week 4)
task_add, task_list, task_next

# Dependency Analysis (Week 5-6)
deps_infer, deps_validate
```

### Coming in Phase 2

```bash
# Conflict detection
/conflicts-check
```

### Knowledge Base YAML Structure

After running `clauxton kb add`, your entries are stored in `.clauxton/knowledge-base.yml`:

```yaml
version: '1.0'
project_name: my-project

entries:
  - id: KB-20251019-001
    title: Use FastAPI framework
    category: architecture
    content: |
      All backend APIs use FastAPI framework.

      Reasons:
      - Async/await support
      - Automatic OpenAPI docs
      - Excellent performance
    tags:
      - backend
      - api
      - fastapi
    created_at: '2025-10-19T10:30:00'
    updated_at: '2025-10-19T10:30:00'
    version: 1
```

**Categories**:
- `architecture`: System design decisions
- `constraint`: Technical/business constraints
- `decision`: Important project decisions with rationale
- `pattern`: Coding patterns and best practices
- `convention`: Team conventions and code style

See [YAML Format Reference](docs/yaml-format.md) for complete schema documentation.
